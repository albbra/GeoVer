### Installation

## Build enviroment.
On Windows, you need **CMake** as build environment.
Go to https://cmake.org/ and find, download, and install the latest version.

## Versioning System
We use git as versioning system.
We recommend using **Tortoise Git** as interface for Windows 10.
However, there are many others tools for git and in case you are already used to one, feel free to used that.

In most cases, we recommend *Tortoise Git*.
Go to https://tortoisegit.org/ and download the latest version.

## Integrated Development Enviroment

We use Visual Studio 2017. You can use the Community Edition from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ or any other higher version.
